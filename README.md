## 1.Chi-Square Test
The chi-square test is one of the most common ways to examine relationships between two or more categorical variables. 
It involves calculating a number, called the chi-square statistic - χ2. Which follows a chi-square distribution. 
The chi-square test relies on the difference between observed and expected values.

### Our hypotheses will be:
                H0 : There is no relationship between 2 Categorical Variables
                     i.e., Both the Variables are Independent of each other.
                HA : There is a relationship between 2 Categorical Variables
                     i.e., Both the Variables are Dependent of each other.

At Significance level:0.05,the Chi-Square static is 0.09 and the p-value is 0.764177,and at the degree of freedom 1 and at significance level(Alpha) 0.05,The critical value is 3.84.

Reject H0 if χ2 >= 3.84 and retain H0 if χ2 < 3.84.Finally, we will check p-value = value of chi-squre > 0.09.If p <= 0.05 ,we reject the
null hypothesis at level 0.05.
As per our results,χ2 is 0.09 and the p-value is 0.764177.So,we will retain the null hypothesis.i.e., There is no relationship between 2
Categorical variables.'Gender' and 'Like Shopping?' both Variables are independent.
