## 1.Chi-Square Test
The chi-square test is one of the most common ways to examine relationships between two or more categorical variables. 
It involves calculating a number, called the chi-square statistic - Ï‡2. Which follows a chi-square distribution. 
The chi-square test relies on the difference between observed and expected values.

### Our hypotheses will be:
                H0 : There is no relationship between 2 Categorical Variables
                     i.e., Both the Variables are Independent of each other.
                HA : There is a relationship between 2 Categorical Variables
                     i.e., Both the Variables are Dependent of each other.
